# Project #1 - The Game!

## The Goal 🎯

Create a game that combines your new **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript** skills!

## Important Dates 🗓️

### Pitch Presentation: March 15

Individually you'll need to present at least 2 game ideas to the LT and TA in order to decide which project you'll develop.

### Project Start: March 18

We officially begin our project development!

### MVP and Deploy: March 25

Individually you'll present your MVP - Minimum Viable Product - to the LT and TA. MVP means you should have a working game and everything you do after this point is adding **sugar**. After the MVPs we'll deploy the games together in order to have enough time to fix any problems that might appear after the deploy.

### Project Presentation: March 29

You'll present your game for everyone! At the end the class will vote on the projects in 4 categories: **Most Aesthetically Pleasing, Most Challenging Coding Wise, Most Original Idea** and **Best Overall!** More info on the presentation below.

## Project Weeks Schedule 👩‍💻

### Standups

We gather in circle and everyone should answer the following questions:

1. What did I do last class (or the last time you worked on the project)
2. What will I do today
3. What are my blockers

### Project Development

We focus totally in developing the projects and the LT and the TA will be here to help you! An excel sheet will be available and you'll need to fill your name in there in order to get help.
